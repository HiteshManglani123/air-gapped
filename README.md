A research project exploring various methods of covert communication across air-gapped systems, with a focus on electromagnetic emissions channels. 

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

### 1. CS Research (`/cs_research`)

Contains multiple proof-of-concept implementations including:
- **Encoder/Decoder Simulator**: RF transmission system using frequency sweeps
- **CPU-based EM Covert Channel**: Electromagnetic emissions through CPU load modulation
- **4-FSK Audio Channel**: Covert communication using audio frequencies
- **Working Pair**: A complete implementation of Adaptive Covert Electromagnetic Transmission (ACET)

### 2. Receiver (`/receiver`)

The receiving component of the system, featuring:
- GUI implementation with burger stack visualization
- HackRF integration for SDR capabilities
- FFT-based signal processing and analysis
- Unit Testing

### 3. Transmitter (`/transmitter`)

The transmission component, including:
- Various attack techniques implementations
- CPU-based transmission methods
- Power supply manipulation techniques

## üî¨ Key Features

- Multiple covert channel implementations
